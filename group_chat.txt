[11/04/23, 5:51:12 PM] Yash: Notes illa mama
[11/04/23, 6:45:36 PM] Prem: ...
[11/04/23, 10:35:15 PM] Yash: 2 mark

1. Describe common Association pattern
A .describe the association between two variables by interpreting a scatterplot, to interpret a correlation coefficient, and to understand the limitations of correlation coefficients.

2.write about DDL and DML
Ans: DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which defines the structure or schema of the database. DML, or the Data Manipulation Language, helps us deal with managing and manipulating data in the database. DCL, or the Data Control Language, helps us deal with controls, rights, and permission in the database system.

3. List out the types of visibility
Ans: The three visibility modes are private, protected and public.

4.mention any four rules of object oriented database system?
Ans:These are Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Polymorphism and Inheritance. These are also called as four pillars of Object Oriented Programming.

5. Define OCL?
Ans:Object Constraint Language
The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is a declarative language describing rules applying to Unified Modeling Language (UML) models developed at IBM and is now part of the UML standard.

6. write about properties of relationship

7.define DBMS
A database management system (or DBMS) is essentially nothing more than a computerized data-keeping system. Users of the system are given facilities to perform several kinds of operations on such a system for either manipulation of the data in the database or the management of the database structure itself.

8.what is schema.
A database schema defines how data is organized within a relational database; this is inclusive of logical constraints such as, table names, fields, data types, and the relationships between these entities.

9.why analysis is a difficult activity 

10. What is axioms
Armstrong's Axiom is a mathematical notation used to find the functional dependencies in a database. Conceived by William W. Armstrong, it is a list of axioms or inference rules that can be implemented on any relational database. It is denoted by the symbol F+.

[13/04/23, 5:06:03 AM] Praveen A: ```UNIT 3
Part - A
1. Memory-mapped I/O and I/O-mapped I/O are two methods used in microprocessors to communicate with I/O devices. Memory-mapped I/O uses the same address space as the memory for both memory and I/O devices. In contrast, I/O-mapped I/O uses a separate address space for I/O devices. In memory-mapped I/O, the processor communicates with I/O devices using load and store instructions, while in I/O-mapped I/O, the processor communicates with I/O devices using specific input and output instructions.

2. The hardware interrupts of 8085 are:
- INTR (Interrupt Request)
- RST 7.5 (Restart 7.5)
- RST 6.5 (Restart 6.5)
- RST 5.5 (Restart 5.5)
- TRAP

The software interrupts of 8085 are:
- RST 0 (Restart 0)
- RST 1 (Restart 1)
- RST 2 (Restart 2)
- RST 3 (Restart 3)
- RST 4 (Restart 4)

3. Masking is the process of blocking or allowing certain interrupts in a microprocessor. It is required to prioritize the interrupts and avoid conflicts. When an interrupt occurs, the microprocessor suspends its current execution and serves the interrupt. However, if multiple interrupts occur simultaneously, the microprocessor must decide which one to serve first. By masking certain interrupts, the microprocessor can prioritize and handle them in a specific order.

4. The HOLD signal is used to request the microprocessor to halt its current execution and enter a HOLD state. In this state, the microprocessor relinquishes control of the system bus and waits for an external device to take control. The HOLD signal is typically used by slower devices that need to access the system bus temporarily, such as an I/O device that needs to transfer data.

5. DI (Disable Interrupts) and EI (Enable Interrupts) are instructions used in microprocessors to control the interrupt system. The DI instruction disables the interrupts, while the EI instruction enables them. These instructions are used to prevent interrupts from occurring during critical sections of code or to re-enable interrupts after they have been masked.

Unit-4
Part-A
1. The 8086 microcontroller can operate in two modes: minimum mode and maximum mode.

2. The data size of the 8086 microcontroller is 16 bits, while the address size is 20 bits.

3. The segment registers of 8086 are:
- Code Segment (CS)
- Data Segment (DS)
- Stack Segment (SS)
- Extra Segment (ES)

4. The various flags of 8086 are:
- Carry flag (CF)
- Parity flag (PF)
- Auxiliary Carry flag (AF)
- Zero flag (ZF)
- Sign flag (SF)
- Trap flag (TF)
- Interrupt flag (IF)
- Direction flag (DF)
- Overflow flag (OF)

5. In 8086 microcontroller, a queue is a data structure that stores data in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. It is implemented using the stack segment register (SS) and the stack pointer register (SP). The queue is created by initializing the SS and SP registers to a specific memory location, and data is pushed into the queue using the PUSH instruction and popped from the queue using the POP instruction.```

2. Convex: A shape or curve that is curved outward or has no indentations.

3. Binarysort: A sorting algorithm that divides a list into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the two halves back together.

4. Quick sort: A sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the list into two sub-lists, one containing elements smaller than the pivot and the other containing elements larger than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the two sub-lists.

5. Optimal binary search tree: A binary search tree that minimizes the expected cost of searching for a key in the tree.

6. Huffman coding: A data compression technique that assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequency of occurrence in the input data.

7. Assignment problem: A problem in which a set of tasks must be assigned to a set of workers, each with different capacities and costs, such that the total cost is minimized.

8. Job sequencing: A problem in which a set of jobs must be scheduled on a single machine, subject to precedence constraints and minimizing the total completion time.

[09/05/23, 7:34:16 PM] Prem: Hello all ... 
Refer the handwritten notes that was shared. If there is variation in the method of solving any problem, follow that notes. Bcz tat would b d answer key.

Bcz knapsack problem i think is solved in a different way . Same was expected in CAE2.

Regarding important questions - the question papers of all subjects are not coming as expected so we cannot guess any topic to important. 
So please try to cover all topics and problems. 

For an algorithm they might not give a problem to solve and question might be generic lik 
"Explain job sequence problem with an example" so try practising with a sample example. 

Thank you.

[11/05/23, 1:32:51 AM] Rajan: 1. Knapsack Travelling: A problem in which a traveler has to pack a knapsack with a limited capacity while maximizing the value of the items packed.

2. Convex: A shape or curve that is curved outward or has no indentations.

3. Binarysort: A sorting algorithm that divides a list into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the two halves back together.

4. Quick sort: A sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the list into two sub-lists, one containing elements smaller than the pivot and the other containing elements larger than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the two sub-lists.

5. Optimal binary search tree: A binary search tree that minimizes the expected cost of searching for a key in the tree.

6. Huffman coding: A data compression technique that assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequency of occurrence in the input data.

7. Assignment problem: A problem in which a set of tasks must be assigned to a set of workers, each with different capacities and costs, such that the total cost is minimized.

8. Job sequencing: A problem in which a set of jobs must be scheduled on a single machine, subject to precedence constraints and minimizing the total completion time.

[20/07/23, 8:51:03 AM] Praveen : 1. Define Linear Programming problem?
2. List out steps of Modelling phases?
3. Point out the properties of Linear programming solution?
4. List the four assumptions in Linear programming?
5. Describe the principal components of Decision problem?
 6.Locate suitable area for assignment problem?
 7.Define operation research?
 8. Difference between balanced & unbalanced  
    in assignment & transportation problem?
 9.what is linear programming 
  10.what are the assumptions in linear   programming
11. Write methods to find basic feasible solutions ? 
12Difference between simplex & Big M Method?13. What is feasibility region? Illustrate is it necessary that it should always be a convex set?
14. Define slack variable?
15. What are Surplus variable? And compare with slack variable.




1.Linear programming is a mathematical optimization technique used to find the best possible solution to a problem with linear constraints and a linear objective function.
2.Identify decision variables.
Define the objective function.
Specify constraints.
Determine feasible region.
Consider non-negativity constraints.
Refine and adjust the model.
Test the model with known solutions.
Conduct sensitivity analysis.
Document the model.

3.Optimality: The solution is optimal, representing the best possible solution given the objective function and constraints.

Feasibility: The solution is feasible, satisfying all constraints imposed by the problem.

4.Proportionality

Additivity

Certainty

Divisibility
5.Decision maker: The individual or entity responsible for making the decision. They are tasked with evaluating options and selecting the best course of action.

Alternatives: The different choices or options available to the decision maker. These alternatives represent different potential actions or strategies that can be taken to address the problem or achieve the desired outcome
6. The suitable area for the assignment problem is in personnel management and transportation/logistics
7.Operations research (OR) optimizes decision-making using math and analytical methods, improving efficiency and performance in organizations.
8.Balanced: Equal supply and demand, feasible without additional adjustments.
Unbalanced: Mismatch between supply and demand, may require modifications or constraints for feasibility.
9.Linear programming is a method for optimizing a linear objective function with linear constraints.
It involves maximizing or minimizing a linear objective while satisfying a set of linear constraints.
10.The assumptions in linear programming are proportionality and additivity of variables, as well as certainty of input data and divisibility of decision variables.
11.Three methods to find basic feasible solutions in linear programming:

Graphical method (for two variables): Plot feasible region, identify corner points.
Corner-point method (for more than two variables): Evaluate objective function at corner points.
Simplex method: Algorithmically pivot through corner points to reach optimal solution.
12.Simplex Method: It is used to solve linear programming problems with feasible initial solutions by iteratively moving towards an optimal solution.
Big M Method: It is specifically designed to handle problems with initial infeasibility by introducing artificial variables and a penalty term (M) to convert the problem into a feasible one

Simplex Method: It assumes that the initial constraints are feasible or have a feasible basic solution to start the iteration process.
Big M Method: It can handle initial infeasibility by adding artificial variables and a large penalty term (M) to make the problem feasible. The artificial variables are later eliminated in subsequent iterations.
13 . The feasibility region is the set of feasible solutions in a linear programming problem. It may or may not be a convex set, depending on the nature of the constraints involved.
14 .A slack variable is a non-negative variable used in linear programming to represent the surplus or slack in a constraint, indicating the difference between the left-hand side and right-hand side of the constraint.
15. Slack variables measure underutilization in a constraint (left-hand side < right-hand side), while surplus variables measure overutilization (left-hand side > right-hand side) in linear programming.

[26/02/24, 6:42:29 AM] Sha: VC dimension: Measure of the capacity of a hypothesis class in binary classification. It represents the maximum number of points that can be shattered by the class.

Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that improve their performance on a task as they are exposed to more data.

Occam's Razor: Principle that suggests among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. In machine learning, it favors simpler models over complex ones to prevent overfitting.

Types of learning: Supervised learning (with labeled data), unsupervised learning (without labeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning from feedback through interaction with an environment).

0/1 loss function: A loss function that penalizes predictions as either entirely correct (0 loss) or entirely incorrect (1 loss), without considering the degree of error.

Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features. It's commonly used for text classification tasks.

Bayes theorem: A fundamental theorem in probability theory that describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. It's a key concept in Bayesian statistics and machine learning.

Bias and variance: Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. Variance refers to the model's sensitivity to changes in the training data, leading to high variability in predictions. Balancing bias and variance is crucial for building accurate machine learning models

Pattern: Description of the structure of a token.
Lexeme: Actual sequence of characters in the source program that matches the pattern for a token.

5. Handle: A substring of right sentential form that matches the production body in a leftmost derivation.
Handle Pruning: Elimination of intermediate steps in a leftmost derivation to reduce the number of handles.

6. Problems with top-down parsing: Left recursion, backtracking, ambiguity, and the inability to handle left-recursive grammars.

7. Conflicts in Shift Reduce Parser: Shift-reduce conflicts arise when both shifting and reducing are possible at a certain parsing state, leading to ambiguity in the parsing process.

[08/04/24, 8:24:46 AM] Prem: while yylval typically contains the actual value of the integer
[08/04/24, 8:24:47 AM] Prem: A string named yytext. This string contains a sequence of characters making up a single input token
[08/04/24, 8:24:47 AM] Prem: Function yywrap is called by lex when input is exhausted. Return 1 if you are done or 0 if more processing is required. Every C program requires a main function. In this case we simply call yylex that is the main entry-point for lex.
[08/04/24, 8:24:47 AM] Prem: some memory allocated by LEX which can be accessed through the character pointer yytext. NOTE: The %option noyywrap is used to inform the compiler that the function yywrap() has not been defined. We will see what this function does later on.
[08/04/24, 8:24:48 AM] Prem: Lex is a tool or a computer program that generates Lexical Analyzers (converts the stream of characters into tokens). The Lex tool itself is a compiler
[08/04/24, 8:24:48 AM] Prem: A parser is a program that is part of the compiler, and parsing is part of the compiling process. Parsing happens during the analysis stage of compilation

[06/05/24, 12:10:54 PM] Premachandar: The mapper's job in Hadoop is to process data. If the output directory specified in the output format already exists, MapReduce execution typically seeks further instructions, although the exact behavior can depend on the specific configuration.

Apache YARN stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator. It's a framework-specific entity in Hadoop that negotiates resources from the Resource Manager.

Part B:

1. **Define MapReduce:**
MapReduce is a programming model and processing technique used for parallel processing of large datasets in distributed computing environments. It divides the processing into two phases: Map phase for data filtering and sorting, and Reduce phase for summarization and aggregation of the results from the Map phase.

2. **What is Data Serialization?**
Data Serialization is the process of converting structured data or object state into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, or reconstructed later. It's commonly used in data storage, data exchange between systems, and in distributed computing to serialize objects for transmission over a network.

3. **Why use YARN in Hadoop?**
YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is used in Hadoop to manage cluster resources efficiently by separating the resource management and job scheduling functionalities from the MapReduce engine. It allows multiple data processing engines to run simultaneously on Hadoop clusters, improving resource utilization and overall performance.

4. **Differentiate between MapReduce and YARN:**
MapReduce is a programming model and processing paradigm used for distributed processing of large datasets, while YARN is a resource management framework in Hadoop that manages cluster resources and schedules jobs. YARN enables multiple processing engines to run on Hadoop clusters, not just MapReduce.

5. **List out the YARN Features:**
- Scalability: YARN can handle large-scale clusters with thousands of nodes.
- Flexibility: Supports multiple processing engines like MapReduce, Apache Spark, Apache Flink, etc.
- Resource Management: Efficiently manages cluster resources like CPU, memory, and disk.
- Fault Tolerance: Provides fault tolerance mechanisms for job execution.
- Compatibility: Integrates with various Hadoop ecosystem tools and frameworks.
- Dynamic Resource Allocation: Dynamically allocates resources based on application requirements.
- Security: Provides security features like authentication and authorization.

2. Hdfs - hadoop distributed file system

[16/08/24, 4:39:58 PM] Premachandar: Dear Students,
            With reference to the below mail,  this is to inform you that, In addition to your CGPA, some companies are now requesting information about your performance in the internal assessments conducted by the placement cell. So, if companies ask we will be giving your performances here and there. Therefore, it is important to perform well in each test you take.
Students who have been already placed or shortlisted through On-Campus in some companies. Since they have cracked various rounds and have been placed or are under process, we are considering them for these ranking tests.
Students attached to the Excel sheet will have two tests on 17.08.24 (8.45 AM-11.00 AM & 12.45 PM-3.00 PM). If you have your practical in any of the slots, you can skip one test. 
The skipped test will be conducted on 19.08.24. 
If you don't have your practicals, it is a must to attend both tests tomorrow (17.08.24).
These tests are purely Coding. 
The shortlisting has been done according to the below criteria:
30% and above in each section (namely, quants, verbal, reasoning, and coding) in 3 SEATs and AMCAT. 
Yellow-lighted Students: You are asked to bring your laptops fully charged.
We are planning to shortlist another batch of students as well. Communication will be sent on 19.08.24 regarding this. These students will have tests next week. 
Date: 17.08.24
Timing: 
Test 1:   8.45 AM-11.00 AM ( Coding Test )
Test 2:  12.45 PM-3.00 PM  (Coding Test)
