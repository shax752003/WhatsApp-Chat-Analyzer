[08/07/24, 7:20:30 PM] Rakshita Suresh: A ship needs to transport a certain number of people from point A to point B. The capacity of the ship is donated by an integer C, and the total number of people to be transported is donated by an integer N. Your task is to find and return the number of rounds the ship needs to make in order to transport all the people from point A to point B. 
Example1:
Input1:50
Input2:200
Output:4
Here the ship has a capacity of 50 people and needs to transport 200 people.since the ship can accommodate 50 people at a time it will need to make 4rounds to transport all the people from point a to point b .in each round the ship will transport 50 people until all 200 people are transported hence 4 is Returned as output
